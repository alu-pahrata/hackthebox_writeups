Well ok, looks like I'm starting my writeup by doing what can be considered one of the easiest machines to hack. Gotta set that bar low. 
Bit of a warning, since I did an oopsie and took photos instead of all copy pasting from the terminal, whoops.
So if any of the data seems incosistent, I'm sorry about that, and I'll be sure that my next writeup isnt as bad as this one.

Anyways. Lame. First step, boot up Armitage. I know most people's instincts is to boot up nmap, but I like using Armitage, 
Especially when I know that a specific machine is CVE heavy for reasons that will become apparent soon. 
(This writeup was written before I started using zenmap instead of armitage)

After importing the host into Armitage, I run an intensive nmap scan directly from it. Because when it completes, it gives me a handy list like so:

Name           Port             proto                info
ftp            21               tcp                  vsftpd 2.3.4
ssh            22               tcp                  Openssh 4.7p1
netbios-ssn    139              tcp                  Samba smbd 3.x-4.x workgroup: WORKGROUP Debian 8ubuntu1 protocol 2.0
netbios-ssn    445              tcp                  Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian workgroup: WORKGROUP

Immediately we can see that on port 21 that vsftpd 2.3.4 (An FTP server for Unix Systems) is running. 
So naturally, lets see if there are any exploits for that particular version. I search for this through metasploits own search function

msf5> search vsftpd 2.3.4

Matching Modules
================
  Name
  ----
  exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

Its a match! There is a backdoor command execution exploit specifically for this particular version of vsftpd. 
But it seems too good to be true… Let’s try it out anyways. 

[*] 10.10.10.3:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
[*] 10.10.10.3:21 - USER: 331 Please specify the password.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created. 

Oof, it didn’t work. (To read more about the exploit used, you can find it on rapid7 
https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) 
That’s not a problem though, we have other services that we found which can be used. 

We can potentially use the Samba 3.0.20 as a way in. It’s running on port 445. Like I did with the vsftpd attempt. 
I use metasploits search function to try and find an exploit that may work and end up with way too many entries than I can
reasonably sort through.

So with a bit of google-foo. I search for “Samba 3.0.20 exploit” And I’m greeted with the first result:

https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

The good news for me, is that my metasploit database already has this very specific exploit. So I run it and a command shell session
opens, which means that I'm in! After that finding the flags are simple enough.

The user flag can be found in: /home/makeis/user.txt

The root flag can be found in /root/root.txt

And that concludes the intrusion of this machine. 

Truthfully speaking, this is one of the easiest machines that hackthebox.eu has to offer. 
It serves as a great entry point as for what to expect when it comes to what machines you may find on their platform.
