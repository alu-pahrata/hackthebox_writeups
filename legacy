Well, Legacy, Second easiest box. Lets get this over with, shall we?
 
Step one, yeet that IP into Zenmap, and run a "Intense scan, all TCP ports" profile on it. I choose TCP (Because I'm a scrub) 
Because the difficulty matrix on this machine indicates that CVE plays a very important factor. 
And when there are CVE exploits, more often than not there are Metasploit modules that you can use. 
And it should go without saying, that Metasploit modules are very fun to use.
 
The scan should take less than 10 minutes to complete, but when it finishes, check out the services tab, 
and that should give us our start.
 
Port   Protocol   State   Version
445    tcp        open    Windows XP microsoft-ds
3389   tcp        closed  N/A
139    tcp        open    Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
 
Well, we have 2 open ports, and 1 closed port. This should be relatively easy to work with. As a start, let's look up some 
potential exploits for that service running on port 455.
 
After a bit of google-fu, I stumble upon a Rapid7 page for "MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption." *1 
Which makes me very excited.
 
For those of you that don't know, EternalBlue was an exploit created by the NSA (National Security Agency) to target Windows XP Machines. 
It was leaked sometime around 2017, and was the leading reason behind why the Ransomware Wannacry/Wannacrypt spread so quickly. 
Microsoft actually released a patch for this exploit despite ending all support for Windows XP in 2014 because of how destructive 
this exploit was. For a bit of context, Wannacry completely shut down the NHS (National Health Service) for the United Kingdom, 
resulting in around 92M GBP in damages and a screeching halt to systems all across the organization *2. 
Not fun, especially when the kill switch was an unregistered domain *3. Sorry if I'm rambling, before I got into cyber security 
and started using hackthebox, I followed this ransomware and the subsequent take down of it pretty closely. 
So using something EternalBlue is a mix of nostalgia and excitement for me. But I'm rambling again.
 
Throwing the search term "eternalblue" into the msfconsole leads us to 5 modules that we can potentially use.

Module #2 (Not to be confused with #1. Yes I am starting at 0 like an array) seems to be rather hopeful. For obvious reason, #0 and #1 wont work because we're trying to exploit the system. And #3 won't work because this is a Windows XP machine. However, let's not rule out #4 just yet. For now we'll try #2

The exploit target is for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. This probably won't work, but it doesn't hurt to test it out.

Yeah, I expected that much. It's a shame but it does give us some valuable information, 
the system is probably vulnerable to MS17-010. So in responce, lets try module #4 on our list.

well, look at that, by using the EternalBlue exploit, we managed to open a shell in our target system. 
From here on out it should be clear sailing.
 
As is customary, the flag for root pwn can be found in the desktop folder of the admin user. 
The flag for the user pwn can be found under the user "john."
 
Overall this box was very fun. While it is one of the easier boxes that HTB hosts, 
it was much fun finally using Eternalblue after reading about it so much a couple years ago.
